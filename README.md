# OctoPrint-Unskew

If you've got a skewed printer frame and no amount of jiggery-pokering will fix it, this plugin will modify outgoing GCODE to compensate.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/eaton/OctoPrint-Unskew/archive/master.zip

## Configuration

Set the X, Y, and Z error offsets, as well as the size of the cube used to calibrate. That's it, buddy.
